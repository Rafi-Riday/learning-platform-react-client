        "answer": "In <span className='text-sky-500'>ReactJS</span>, <span className='text-indigo-500'>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)</span> refers to the method that allows you to make requests to the server deployed at a different domain. As a reference, if the <u>frontend</u> and <u>backend</u> are at two different domains, we need <span className='text-indigo-500'>CORS</span> there."

        "answer": "The <span className='text-orange-500'>Firebase</span> Realtime Database lets to build rich, collaborative applications by allowing secure access to the database directly from client-side code. Data is persisted locally, and even while offline, realtime events continue to fire, giving the end user a responsive experience.<hr className='my-4' /><span className='text-indigo-400'>Supabase</span> is another open source alternative to <span className='text-orange-500'>Firebase</span>, and the main difference is that it is a <span className='text-indigo-400'>SQL</span> database rather than <span className='text-green-500'>NoSQL</span>. Many users love it because it also offers real-time data, authentication for multiple services, file storage, and more.But <span className='text-orange-500'>firebase</span> offers you features such as analytics, databases, communication, crashes notification and etc. It allows you to move and concentrate on your customers. <span className='text-orange-500'>Firebase</span> is designed and scaled on Google resources, even with the largest apps. <span className='text-orange-500'>Firebase</span> products run well with Android and iOS."

        "question": "The <span className='text-slate-500 font-semibold'>private route</span>",
        "answer": "<span className='text-slate-500 font-semibold'>Private Routes</span> in <span className='text-slate-500 font-semibold'>React Router</span> (also called <span className='text-slate-500 font-semibold'>Protected Routes</span>) require a user being authorized to visit a route. So if a user is not authorized for a specific page, they cannot access it. The most common example is <span className='text-red-500'>authentication</span> in a <span className='text-slate-500 font-semibold'>React</span> application where a user can only access the protected pages when they are authorized (which means in this case being authenticated). <span className='text-red-500'>Authorization</span> goes beyond authentication though. For example, a user can also have roles and permissions which give a user access to specific areas of the application."
